BBC Remarc Project

This project is the open source version of BBC Reminiscence Archive (https://remarc.pilots.bbcconnectedstudio.co.uk/remarc/index.html) which is a web app which lets users navigate to and view audio, video and image content, for the purpose of triggering memories in people with dementia.
An admin system is also included, enabling the upload of media assets, choosing themes, and managing metdata.
Please see the installation and administration instructions for further info
